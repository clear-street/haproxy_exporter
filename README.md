# HAProxy Exporter for Prometheus

This is a simple server that scrapes HAProxy stats and exports them via HTTP for
Prometheus consumption.

## Clear Street Modifications

Although the base project has been marked as archived and point us to the native
Prometheus endpoint we found that there is an issue when haproxy does a live reload
metrics for connections persisting on old workers will not be picked up. This is
due to the Prometheus endpoint only being served from the current process which
does not include metrics from old processes.

To get around this we leverage admin stats socket which also serves metrics and
the minor modifications on code in the haproxy exporter to first list all processes
using the master CLI and export metrics from all processes. This only works on
the Unix socket option.

### How to build a new version

To build a new image update the version [here](https://github.com/clear-street/haproxy_exporter/blob/main/Makefile.common#L83)
and run the following:

```
make docker-amd64

docker push docker.co.clearstreet.io/haproxy_exporter/haproxy-exporter-linux-amd64:<version tag>
```


## Getting Started

To run it:

```bash
./haproxy_exporter [flags]
```

Help on flags:

```bash
./haproxy_exporter --help
```

core developers are accessible via the Prometheus Developers [mailinglist][].

## Usage

### HTTP stats URL

Specify custom URLs for the HAProxy stats port using the `--haproxy.scrape-uri`
flag. For example, if you have set `stats uri /baz`,

```bash
haproxy_exporter --haproxy.scrape-uri="http://localhost:5000/baz?stats;csv"
```

Or to scrape a remote host:

```bash
haproxy_exporter --haproxy.scrape-uri="http://haproxy.example.com/haproxy?stats;csv"
```

Note that the `;csv` is mandatory (and needs to be quoted).

If your stats port is protected by [basic auth][], add the credentials to the
scrape URL:

```bash
haproxy_exporter  --haproxy.scrape-uri="http://user:pass@haproxy.example.com/haproxy?stats;csv"
```

Alternatively, provide the password through a file, so that it does not appear in the process
table or in the output of the ```/debug/pprof/cmdline``` profiling service:

```bash
echo '--haproxy.scrape-uri=http://user:pass@haproxy.example.com/haproxy?stats;csv' > args
haproxy_exporter @args
```

You can also scrape HTTPS URLs. Certificate validation is enabled by default, but
you can disable it using the `--no-haproxy.ssl-verify` flag:

```bash
haproxy_exporter --no-haproxy.ssl-verify --haproxy.scrape-uri="https://haproxy.example.com/haproxy?stats;csv"
```

If scraping a remote HAProxy must be done via an HTTP proxy, you can enable reading of the
standard [`$http_proxy` / `$https_proxy` / `$no_proxy` environment variables](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ProxyFromEnvironment) by using the
`--http.proxy-from-env` flag (these variables will be ignored otherwise):

```bash
export HTTP_PROXY="http://proxy:3128"
haproxy_exporter --http.proxy-from-env --haproxy.scrape-uri="http://haproxy.example.com/haproxy?stats;csv"
```

### Unix Sockets

As alternative to localhost HTTP a stats socket can be used. Enable the stats
socket in HAProxy with for example:


    stats socket /run/haproxy/admin.sock mode 660 level admin


The scrape URL uses the 'unix:' scheme:

```bash
haproxy_exporter --haproxy.scrape-uri=unix:/run/haproxy/admin.sock
```

### TLS and basic authentication

The HAProxy Exporter supports TLS and basic authentication.

To use TLS and/or basic authentication, you need to pass a configuration file
using the `--web.config.file` parameter. The format of the file is described
[in the exporter-toolkit repository](https://github.com/prometheus/exporter-toolkit/blob/master/docs/web-configuration.md).

## Alternatives

### Official Prometheus exporter

As of 2.0.0, HAProxy includes a Prometheus exporter module that can be built into your binary during build time.
For HAProxy 2.4 and higher, pass the `USE_PROMEX` flag to `make`:

```bash
make TARGET=linux-glibc USE_PROMEX=1
```

Pre-built versions, including the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/haproxy), typically have this enabled already.

Once built, you can enable and configure the Prometheus endpoint from your `haproxy.cfg` file as a typical frontend:

```haproxy
frontend stats
    bind *:8404
    http-request use-service prometheus-exporter if { path /metrics }
    stats enable
    stats uri /stats
    stats refresh 10s
```
